- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Data Integration Team for Orion at NASA (Artemis),and finishing up my bachelor's degree in Software Development at Western Governors University. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about... Building Android applications with Java, as well as learning Kotlin so that I can take advantage of Kotlin Multiplatform. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my final project for school: Symbiosis. It's going to be an application and podcast dedicated to spreading knowledge about mental health ailments as well as providing a platform for people to be able to help each other... because the worst thing I felt when I was dealing with my mental health issues when I was younger was that I was completely alone. I hope to educate users and listeners about various mental health ailments that their loved ones may be going through that they might not fully understand. People helping other people. Hence, the name 'Symbiosis'.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email address for all dev-related things is - omarimamdev@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, Him
- âš¡ Fun facts: I love dancing, making choreography, editing music videos and am a flow artist (My main prop is a hoop, and the fact that I am a flow artist is where my nickname "flowmar" came from). I actually got into coding because my friend and I started a small business making hoops to sell to other people. We wanted to start selling them online, so I decided to create a website for us because "MySpace wasn't that hard."
